But the specific development process is relatively long. Each generation has contributed more or less. In fact, zhouyi itself is regarded as one of the earliest divinatory books. (Xu Zhonglin's Romance of Divination, 11th Shibohou youli, a prisoner in the city of Youli, said in the poem, "How could a sovereign abuse his subjects and commit adultery in state affairs? Had it not been for Dan's loyal admonition, he had seen gaojie flesh and blood fly. Seven years zhanhua rain, Fuxi eight diagrams to illustrate the subtle. From the afterlife to Ming Lord, qishan sun is bright. ... And ji Chang to Youli. Enlightenment big line, the army and the people happy, idle, fuxi eight diagrams, repeated Ming, into 64 hexagrams, in the three hundred and eighty lines of images, live in peace, all without hatred of the Lord's heart. Later generations have a poem praise said: seven years of difficult youli city, one by one became clear.
Fortune-telling history began in the Warring States period guiguzi; Another legend comes from Li Xuzhong of the Tang Dynasty, but the pseudonym is Guiguzi. People who want to tell their fortunes often turn to those who have studied numerology or are respected by others. Ancient Chinese called such figures "fortune-tellers". Tarot cards and astrology are also a form of fortune-telling in Western societies. With the development of the network, you can also input your own data to get the results of fortune telling on the network.</p> </div>
