In volume 24 of The Book "True Immortal Body Tao Tongjian", it is said that "The number of Taoist clothes, broken star scarf, neon skirt xia sleeve, and ten huge prayer flags are written here," indicating that Taoist clothing has been customized since Lu Xiujing. "Taiping Imperial Review" volume 65 quoted "Teach sutra" said: Mr. Lu "on the up and down, called the case of the bow, wearing, brown clothes also. Wrap, namely shawl, also make "pei". Brown, "jade" for "robe" solution. Since then, Taoist clothing has gradually taken shape.

	<div class="box3"><div class="text3"><h1>Taiji is Taoism</h1><p>The concept of Tai Chi was first used by Zhuangzi and Yi Zhuan. Generally speaking, in cosmology and methodology, the concept of Tai Chi is mainly inherited from Yi Zhuan: "Yi has Tai Chi, which is the two rites of life. Two instruments give birth to four images, and four images give birth to eight diagrams." The meaning of yi into the process of hexagrams, tai Chi, before the separation of yarrow (Yi divination uses yarrow as a tool), the separation of yarrow, the formation of Yin and Yang two lines, known as the two yi yi. Two lines added together, there are four possible images, known as the four images. Add a line to each of them and they become eight diagrams. This is the process of drawing gossip.
In Chinese classics, Yi Always is a philosophical book that exhausted the mysteries of heaven and earth, and the analysis of the process of forming hexagrams is, fundamentally speaking, an overview of the development of heaven and earth. Taiji gives birth to two instruments, which is the process of forming heaven and earth by the differentiation of Taiji. Two instruments are heaven and earth.
The concept of Tai Chi often appears together with yi Learning. The Taoist yi-ology has its own unique system, and the concept of Taiji is an important basic concept of the cosmology, religious cultivation theory and magic theory of The Taoist Yi-ology.
Legend: "Yi has" tai heng ", is the birth of "two 檥", two yi born "four horses", four elephants born eight diagrams. The word "daheng" in the Book of Changes is interlinked with the word "Taiheng". Representing the arrangement of the two hexagrams in the pre-Qin period, the BOOK of Changes later became the basis for divination.
In order to differentiate qi from qi, Taoist thinkers in the Song Dynasty used the ancient word "Qi" to represent qi and qi, and qi was considered to be qi from qi, or tai Chi. The meanings of the two words are separated again. But apart from Taoist texts, it is usually summarized as qi.</p></div><img src="images/O1CN01PFrsJP1TC3OHnaQSx_!!2031292345.jpg"></div>
