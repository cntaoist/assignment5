		<div class="text" id="skip">Taoist architecture is usually composed of temples, dining halls, dormitories and gardens. Its overall layout basically adopts the traditional Chinese courtyard style, that is, wooden frame as the main structure, single building composed of "room" as a unit, and then single building composed of courtyard, and then courtyard as a unit to form various forms of architectural complex. Temple is the main place of religious activities, often located on the main axis of the architectural complex, as the main body of the entire architectural complex.</div>

	<div class="box2"><img src="images/download (1).jfif"><p class="text2">The core concepts of Taoism are: human law, earth law, heaven law and nature law. Taoism advocates nature and believes that the natural landscape is the main body of all things, and the existence of all things as objects depends on "mountains, forests, valleys and hills". Taoism has the belief of immortals and the belief of mountain worship. That the mountain is a ladder, up and down the heaven; There is god on the mountain, and there is zhi Cao on the mountain. In order to cultivate the immortal, in order to refine the elixir of immortality, mountain, Taoist palace has become the preferred external environment. Therefore, Taoist architecture pays more attention to creating the atmosphere of immortal road, immortal spirit and fairyland. Pay attention to the heart, hope chang God yu zhi. The layout of the building pays particular attention to feng shui. The architectural style contains the situation of "taiji evolution", "harmony between the two instruments" and "the universe and the universe are determined". At the same time, it also reflects the artistic conception of Taoist magic, which is convenient to communicate with the gods and achieve the fairy way self.

	<div class="box3"><p>In its layout, volume and structure, the Taoist instructor view not only distinctly inherits China's traditional architectural ideas, architectural patterns and architectural methods, but also infuses Taoist and Taoist aesthetic thoughts and values, forming its own unique style. The Lord Lao Zi said, "Man rules the earth, the earth rules the heaven, the heaven rules the Tao, and the Tao rules the nature." "The old tao is big, the heaven is big, and the earth is big, so is the king. There are four in the realm, and one of them is the king "(see Tao Te Ching). "Tao" is the root of all things in the universe, and man should imitate the great and boundless nature of the universe. The Taiping Sutra, an early Taoist classic, puts it even more clearly: "Heaven and earth dharma correspond up and down: heaven has a son, and earth also has a son; Heaven has its noon, and earth has its noon; Heaven has obstacles, earth also has obstacles; Heaven has a departure, the earth also has a departure, its corresponding like this.  </p>
